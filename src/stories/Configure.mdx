# Storybook Setup

This Storybook is configured for the Solo game views:

- Global Tailwind styling pulled from `src/index.css`.
- A memory router decorator to satisfy React Router hooks.
- Stories for the Solo start screen, board states, and game-over summary.

Use these docs as a quick reference while browsing the Solo stories.
